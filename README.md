# Simple Linear Regression Model - Econometry

This repository originated from my econometrics classes at UFPB, as part of the Data Science for Business bachelor's course. I developed this Simple Linear Regression class for training and study purposes.

So, if anyone, especially Antônio Vinícius, is reading this, please let me know if I made any mistakes. Thanks!
