# Simple Linear Regression Model - Econometry

This repository originated from my econometrics classes at UFPB, part of the Data Science for Business bachelor's course. I developed this Simple Linear Regression class for training and study purposes. 

So, if there's anyone, or Antônio Vinícius, reading this, please correct me if i did anything wrong. Thank's!
